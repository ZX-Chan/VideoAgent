  1. Use formal, academic language and expand or explain key concepts where appropriate.
  2. Ensure the narration for each section is stylistically consistent, so the overall output reads like a continuous academic explanation, not a set of disjointed segments.
  3. Do NOT use phrases like "This page says..." or "On this slide...".
  4. Output one paragraph per section, as a JSON object with section names as keys and narration as values.
